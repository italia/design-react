The labels present in the header steps can be anticipated by the ordinal number relating to the same.
As shown in the example,  in the case of a completed step instead of the number, a confirmation icon must be included with a text reserved for screen readers.

You need to add the class `.no-line` to the `<li>` active to hide the blue bottom border, in this case redundant.
