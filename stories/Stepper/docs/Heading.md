The visible steps in the header can be accompanied by three additional classes:

- `.confirmed` to locate an already confirmed step. It is a good idea to accompany these steps with an icon that identifies their completion (see below).
- `.active` to identify the currently active step; on mobile it is the only one displayed.
- `.steppers-index` to identify an index, visible only on mobile, which may contain the current state of progress indicated in text form

It is necessary to reduce the browser window to appreciate the behavior of the Steppers on small devices.
