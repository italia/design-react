The Timeline component is characterized by the wrapper `<Timeline>` which contains `<TimelinePin>`.

Each `<TimelinePin>` contains a PIN.

PIN : each pin contains an `icon`, and a `label` indicating the date of the event.

The `<TimelinePin>` has three class variations-
* Default- Used for upcoming events.
* `now` - Used for present event. A `nowText` is associated with this.
* `past`- Used for past events.
